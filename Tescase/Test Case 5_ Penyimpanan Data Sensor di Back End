Feature: Storing sensor data in the Back End system

  Scenario: Back end system receives and stores sensor data from IoT device
    Given the IoT device sends sensor data to the back end
    When the temperature, humidity, and light intensity data are received
    Then the system should store the data in the Postgres database
    And the system should ensure that the data is stored correctly without duplication
    And if the data transmission is incomplete, the system should display an error notification
