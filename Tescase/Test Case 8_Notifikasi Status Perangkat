Feature: Displaying sensor data graph based on time range in the Front End application

  Scenario: User views sensor data graph based on time
    Given the sensor data has been stored in the back end system
    When the user selects a time filter in the front end application (e.g., daily, weekly)
    Then the system should display the sensor data graph according to the selected time range
    And the graph should show temperature, humidity, and light intensity data in a single view
    And if there is no data for the selected time range, the system should display the message "No data available"
