Feature: Sending temperature data from IoT device to Back End

  Scenario: IoT system sends temperature data to back end via 4G modem
    Given the IoT device is active and connected to the back end
    When the IoT device detects the environmental temperature
    Then the system should send the temperature data to the back end in real-time
    And the temperature data should be transmitted via the 4G modem
    And the system should retry sending the data up to 3 times if the transmission fails
    And the system should display an error message if the transmission fails after all retries
