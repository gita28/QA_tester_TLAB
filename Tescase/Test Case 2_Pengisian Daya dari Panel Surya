Feature: Charging from solar panel on IoT device

  Scenario: IoT device charges using solar panel
    Given the IoT device is exposed to sunlight
    When the system detects that the battery requires charging
    Then the device should start charging using the solar panel
    And the charging status should be displayed in real-time
    And the device should continue to function during the charging process
    And the system should display an error message if the charging process fails
