Feature: Displaying sensor data in the Front End application

  Scenario: Sensor data is displayed in real-time on the front end
    Given the back end system has sent sensor data to the front end
    When the user opens the front end application
    Then the system should display the temperature, humidity, and light intensity data in real-time
    And the data should be updated whenever there is a change from the IoT device
    And the user should be able to filter the data based on time (daily, hourly, weekly)
